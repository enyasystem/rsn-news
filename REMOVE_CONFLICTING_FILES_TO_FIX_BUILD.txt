To fix the build error, you must remove one of the following conflicting files:

- pages/api/news.ts
- app/api/news/route.ts

Choose which API route style you want to use (pages or app directory) and delete the other file. You cannot have both for the same route.

If you want file upload support, keep pages/api/news.ts and delete app/api/news/route.ts.
If you want to use the new app directory API routes, keep app/api/news/route.ts and delete pages/api/news.ts (but you will need to add file upload support there).

After deleting the conflicting file, re-run your build.
